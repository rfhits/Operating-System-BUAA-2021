/*
 * This file defines three types of data structures: lists, tail queues,
 * and circular queues.
 *
 * A list is headed by a single forward pointer(or an array of forward
 * pointers for a hash table header). The elements are doubly linked
 * so that an arbitrary element can be removed without a need to
 * traverse the list. New elements can be added to the list before
 * or after an existing element or at the head of the list. A list
 * may only be traversed in the forward direction.
 *
 * A tail queue is headed by a pair of pointers, one to the head of the
 * list and the other to the tail of the list. The elements are doubly
 * linked so that an arbitrary element can be removed without a need to
 * traverse the list. New elements can be added to the list before or
 * after an existing element, at the head of the list, or at the end of
 * the list. A tail queue may only be traversed in the forward direction.
 *
 * A circle queue is headed by a pair of pointers, one to the head of the
 * list and the other to the tail of the list. The elements are doubly
 * linked so that an arbitrary element can be removed without a need to
 * traverse the list. New elements can be added to the list before or after
 * an existing element, at the head of the list, or at the end of the list.
 * A circle queue may be traversed in either direction, but has a more
 * complex end of list detection.
 *
 * For details on the use of these macros, see the queue(3) manual page.

 * A list is headed by a structure defined by the LIST_HEAD macro.  This structure con‐
 * tains a single pointer to the first element on the list.  The elements are doubly
 * linked so that an arbitrary element can be removed without traversing the list.  New
 * elements can be added to the list after an existing element or at the head of the list.
 * A LIST_HEAD structure is declared as follows:
 *
 *       LIST_HEAD(HEADNAME, TYPE) head;
 *
 * where HEADNAME is the name of the structure to be defined, and TYPE is the type of the
 * elements to be linked into the list.
